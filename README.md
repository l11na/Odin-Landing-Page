# Odin-Landing-Page

Jumping back into web development after a months-long break, with my second project on the TOP curriculum.

I will be creating a landing page from scratch, based on a provided design. The design includes two images that showcase the complete website and provide details on fonts and colors used.

I am excited to put what I've learnt so far to the test!
